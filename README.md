# Discretize distributions
Approximation of (mixture of) multivariate Gaussian distributions with discrete (categorical float) distributions in Pytorch. 
This package implements the approximation procedure as introduced in Seciton 5 of [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18707]

**Note: Documetation is still in progress.**

## Installation
```bash
pip install discretize_distributions
```
